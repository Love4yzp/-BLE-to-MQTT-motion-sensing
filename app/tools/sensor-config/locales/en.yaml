config:
  threshold_label: "Motion Sensitivity (Threshold 0x02-0x3F)"
  threshold_explanation: >-
    Sensitivity determines how much motion triggers detection.
    Lower values = more sensitive (responds to light touch) but may false-trigger;
    higher values = less sensitive (requires bigger motion), good for avoiding false positives.
  tail_label: "Detection Hold Time (Tail Window 1000-10000ms)"
  tail_explanation: >-
    How long the sensor keeps broadcasting after detecting a pickup.
    Longer = merges repeated actions (e.g. pick up and put down quickly) but uses more power;
    shorter = saves battery but rapid handling may trigger multiple events.
  tx_label: "Signal Power (TX Power -40 to 4 dBm)"
  tx_explanation: >-
    BLE broadcast signal strength.
    Higher power = longer range to gateway (recommended for wide shelf spacing);
    lower power = saves battery, suitable when gateway is nearby.
